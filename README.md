TechTest - A rough prototype for a carousel with lazy loading
==============================================================

This is quite an old piece of code, but I still keep it since I like the idea I came up with, even though it's quite a common approach to bandwidth optimiziation.

The carousel saves bandwidth and improves the overall user experience preloading only the previous and next slide.

```
npm install -g http-server
```

You can run the project simply by launching an http-server in the root folder of this project:
